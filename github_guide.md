# GitHub Guide

This guide provides an overview of how to navigate and use GitHub.

## Creating a Repository

To create a new repository:

1. Click the '+' icon in the upper right corner of your GitHub homepage and select 'New repository'.
2. Choose whether the repo should be public (visible to everyone) or private (only visible to you and collaborators you choose).
3. Add a name and an optional description for your repository.
4. You can also initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license file if desired.

## Forking a Repository

Forking a repository means to create a copy of it in your own GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. To fork a repository:

1. Go to the repository you want to fork.
2. Click the 'Fork' button in the upper right corner of the repository page.
3. You'll be taken to your copy of the repository, where you can make changes.

## Making and Merging Pull Requests

A pull request is a way of proposing changes from one branch to another:

1. Navigate to the original repository you created your fork from.
2. Click the "Pull request" button.
3. You can then specify which branch you'd like to merge changes from, as well as which branch the changes should be merged into.
4. After you've created the pull request, others can review your proposed changes and decide whether or not to merge them.

## Managing Branches

On GitHub, you can create branches to work on different tasks separately:

1. Go to your repository page and click on the 'Branch' dropdown menu.
2. Type a unique name into the new branch text box and select 'Create branch'.
3. You can switch between branches by going back to the 'Branch' dropdown and selecting the one you want to work on.
4. Changes made on one branch won't affect other branches, so you can work freely without impacting the main project.

## Using GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to host a website directly from a repository:

1. Go to the repository settings.
2. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
3. Select the branch you'd like to deploy and choose a theme for your website.
4. After setting up, GitHub will provide a URL where your website is hosted.

Remember, this guide just covers some basic GitHub features. There are plenty more features and possibilities with GitHub, so don't be afraid to explore and experiment!
